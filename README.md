# Ecom-Matrix
![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)
- Ecommerce back end service for an Ecommerce website!

## Description

- My motivation for building this application was to provide an easy-to-use solution for individuals who have an ecommerce website but struggle to manage the backend.
- This project was built to support ecommerce website owners who lack the technical expertise or resources to develop and maintain a backend system.
- This solves the problem of not being able to efficiently manage and operate an ecommerce website without a robust backend infrastructure.
- In this project, I learned that creating a user-friendly and scalable backend system is crucial for enabling ecommerce website owners to focus on their business without worrying about backend complexities.

## Installation

You'll need to install GitBash, VS Code, Node.js, NPM dotenv, NPM pg, NPM sequelize, Express, PostgreSQL, and nodemon (not necessary). From here you will need knowledge on how to clone a repo from GitHub over to your device to store it locally. Once its stored locally on your device you can open VSCode. Lastly once VSCode is running open the CLI (Command-Line-Interface), type npm install for the node_modules packages, and then type npm run start. Once you've done this the website can be deployed locally for testing, debugging, and developing.

## Usage

The Ecom Matrix is convienient for anyone needing a backend service for a website where they only have the front end developed (refactor essential).
